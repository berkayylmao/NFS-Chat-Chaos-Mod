## NFS Chat Chaos Mod
Welcome to the official NFS Chat Chaos Mod repository!

## What does this mod do?
- Similar to the [GTA Chaos Mod](https://github.com/gta-chaos-mod), it activates effects in the corresponding game every X seconds.
- All effects have their own cooldown and duration values which can be customized in-game.

- It will also:
  - Disable the ability to reset the player's car or be auto-reset.

## My game's crashing!
Great! Create an issue with the `.log` and `.dmp` files from the `CrashDumps` folder. (Best to archive them into a `.zip` file or similar)

## I have a suggestion for an effect!
Also great! Feel free to create an issue with that as well, best to explain what it should do in detail.

It could be that it is pretty much impossible to implement, or that I just won't consider working on it because there are already effects that are similar to it though, so keep that in mind.

## **ATTENTION, ALL STREAMERS!**
You don't have to, but it'd be amazing to see your streams tagged with `#chaos` or something similar. I wouldn't mind dropping in!

<sub>Big thanks to [KuruHS](https://www.twitch.tv/kuruhs) for constantly testing and playing the mod on stream multiple times! You wouldn't know about this mod without him. So, go show him some support!</sub>
